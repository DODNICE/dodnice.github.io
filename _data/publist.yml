- title: "Physics-guided probabilistic modeling of extreme precipitation under climate change "
  image: Konduri20.PNG
  description: Earth System Models (ESMs) are the state of the art for projecting the effects of climate change. However, longstanding uncertainties in their ability to simulate regional and local precipitation extremes and related processes inhibit decision making. Existing state-of-the art approaches for uncertainty quantification use Bayesian methods to weight ESMs based on a balance of historical skills and future consensus. Here we propose an empirical Bayesian model that extends an existing skill and consensus based weighting framework and examine the hypothesis that nontrivial, physics-guided measures of ESM skill can help produce reliable probabilistic characterization of climate extremes. Specifically, the model leverages knowledge of physical relationships between temperature, atmospheric moisture capacity, and extreme precipitation intensity to iteratively weight and combine ESMs and estimate probability distributions of return levels. Out-of-sample validation suggests that the proposed Bayesian method, which incorporates physics-guidance, has the potential to derive reliable precipitation projections, although caveats remain and the gain is not uniform across all cases.

- title: " Resilience of Urban Transport Network-of-Networks under Intense Flood Hazards Exacerbated by Targeted Attacks"
  image: SmartPub.png
  description: Natural hazards including floods can trigger catastrophic failures in interdependent urban transport network-of-networks (NoNs). Population growth has enhanced transportation demand while urbanization and climate change have intensified urban floods. However, despite the clear need to develop actionable insights for improving the resilience of critical urban lifelines, the theory and methods remain underdeveloped. Furthermore, as infrastructure systems become more intelligent, security experts point to the growing threat of targeted cyber-physical attacks during natural hazards. Here we develop a hypothesis-driven resilience framework for urban transport NoNs, which we demonstrate on the London Rail Network (LRN). We find that topological attributes designed for maximizing efficiency rather than robustness render the network more vulnerable to compound natural-targeted disruptions including cascading failures. Our results suggest that an organizing principle for post-disruption recovery may be developed with network science principles. Our findings and frameworks can generalize to urban lifelines and more generally to real-world spatial networks.  authors: Nishant Yadav, Samrat Chatterjee & Auroop R. Ganguly

- title: " Hybrid Method of Recovery: Combining Topology and Optimization for Transportation Systems"
  image: TBG_ARPES.png
  description: Designing effective recovery strategies for damaged networks is important across built, human, and natural systems. Postperturbation network recovery has been motivated by two distinct philosophies, specifically, the use of centrality measures in complex networks versus network optimization measures. The hypothesis that hybrid approaches may offer complementary value and improve our understanding of recovery processes while informing real-world restoration strategies has not been systematically examined. This research shows that the two distinct network philosophies can be blended to form a hybrid recovery strategy that is more effective than either. Network centrality–based metrics tend to be intuitive and computationally efficient but remain static irrespective of the desired functionality or damage pattern. Optimization-based approaches, while usually less intuitive and more computationally expensive, can be dynamically adjusted. The proposed approach, based on edge recovery algorithms with edge importance informed by network flow and node attributes, outperforms recovery informed exclusively either by network centrality or network optimization. We find that optimization methods outperform centrality-based approaches for networks that are large enough for the power law to be manifested, but for treelike networks typically found at smaller scale, the two approaches are competitive and scenario specific.

- title: " Precipitation extremes and depth-duration-frequency under internal climate variability"
  image: TBG_ARPES.png
  description: Natural climate variability, captured through multiple initial condition ensembles, may be comparable to the variability caused by knowledge gaps in future emissions trajectories and in the physical science basis, especially at adaptation-relevant scales and projection horizons. The relations to chaos theory, including sensitivity to initial conditions, have caused the resulting variability in projections to be viewed as the irreducible uncertainty component of climate. The multiplier effect of ensembles from emissions-trajectories, multiple-models and initial-conditions contribute to the challenge. We show that ignoring this variability results in underestimation of precipitation extremes return periods leading to maladaptation. However, we show that concatenating initial-condition ensembles results in reduction of hydroclimate uncertainty. We show how this reduced uncertainty in precipitation extremes percolates to adaptation-relevant-Depth-Duration Frequency curves. Hence, generation of additional initial condition ensembles therefore no longer needs to be viewed as an uncertainty explosion problem but as a solution that can lead to uncertainty reduction in assessment of extremes.

- title: " DeepEmSat: Deep Emulation for Satellite Data Mining"
  image: STS_news.png
  description: The growing volume of Earth science data available from climate simulations and satellite remote sensing offers unprecedented opportunity for scientific insight, while also presenting computational challenges. One potential area of impact is atmospheric correction, where physics-based numerical models retrieve surface reflectance information from top of atmosphere observations, and are too computationally intensive to be run in real time. Machine learning methods have demonstrated potential as fast statistical models for expensive simulations and for extracting credible insights from complex datasets. Here, we develop DeepEmSat: a deep learning emulator approach for atmospheric correction, and offer comparison against physics-based models to support the hypothesis that deep learning can make a contribution to the efficient processing of satellite images.

- title: " Intercomparison of model response and internal variability across climate model ensembles"
  image: PbSpub.png
  description: Characterization of climate uncertainty at regional scales over near-term planning horizons (0–30 years) is crucial for climate adaptation. Climate internal variability (CIV) dominates climate uncertainty over decadal prediction horizons at stakeholders’ scales (regional to local). In the literature, CIV has been characterized indirectly using projections of climate change from multi-model ensembles (MME) instead of directly using projections from multiple initial condition ensembles (MICE), primarily because adequate number of initial condition (IC) runs were not available for any climate model. Nevertheless, the recent availability of significant number of IC runs from one climate model allows for the first time to characterize CIV directly from climate model projections and perform a sensitivity analysis to study the dominance of CIV compared to model response variability (MRV). Here, we measure relative agreement (a dimensionless number with values ranging between 0 and 1, inclusive; a high value indicates less variability and vice versa) among MME and MICE and find that CIV is lower than MRV for all projection time horizons and spatial resolutions for precipitation and temperature. However, CIV exhibits greater dominance over MRV for seasonal and annual mean precipitation at higher latitudes where signals of climate change are expected to emerge sooner. Furthermore, precipitation exhibits large uncertainties and a rapid decline in relative agreement from global to continental, regional, or local scales for MICE compared to MME. The fractional contribution of uncertainty due to CIV is invariant for precipitation and decreases for temperature as lead time progresses towards the end of the century.

- title: " Resilience of the U.S. National Airspace System Airport Network"
  image: DomePub.png
  description: Natural hazards, such as hurricanes and winter storms, computer glitches and technical flaws, and man-made terror or cyber-physical attacks, can lead to localized perturbations of the U.S. national airspace system airport network (NASAN), which can in turn percolate across the interconnected system. Here we develop and demonstrate an approach to quantitatively characterize the robustness of NASAN, defined as loss of critical functions owing to perturbations, and a quantitative framework to select the most efficient and effective post-hazard recovery strategies. The system-level robustness and recovery strategies rely on network science methods and associated attributes. New insights include the central role of network attributes to robustness and optimal recovery sequences. Characterizations of robustness and fragility can inform what-if plans and proactive design, while recovery strategies developed in advance can support systematic, reliable, and timely bounce-back from hazard-related perturbations. The framework can serve as a baseline over which local information or cost optimization can be superposed.

- title: " Quantifying Uncertainty in Discrete-Continuous and Skewed Data with Bayesian Deep Learning"
  image: Pub_BCl.png
  description: Deep Learning (DL) methods have been transforming computer vision with innovative adaptations to other domains including climate change. For DL to pervade Science and Engineering (S&EE) applications where risk management is a core component, well-characterized uncertainty estimates must accompany predictions. However, S&E observations and model-simulations often follow heavily skewed distributions and are not well modeled with DL approaches, since they usually optimize a Gaussian, or Euclidean, likelihood loss. Recent developments in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL), which attempts to capture uncertainties from noisy observations, aleatoric, and from unknown model parameters, epistemic, provide us a foundation. Here we present a discrete-continuous BDL model with Gaussian and lognormal likelihoods for uncertainty quantification (UQ). We demonstrate the approach by developing UQ estimates on "DeepSD'', a super-resolution based DL model for Statistical Downscaling (SD) in climate applied to precipitation, which follows an extremely skewed distribution. We find that the discrete-continuous models outperform a basic Gaussian distribution in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration. Furthermore, we find that the lognormal distribution, which can handle skewed distributions, produces quality uncertainty estimates at the extremes. Such results may be important across S&E, as well as other domains such as finance and economics, where extremes are often of significant interest. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first UQ model in SD where both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties are characterized.

  description: The paper finds spatial coverage of extreme meteorological drought in the recent years (post-2010) exceeds that of the iconic droughts of the 1930s (the Dust Bowl era), and the 1950s. These results are in contrast with trends in spatial variance that does not exhibit any statistically significant trend. In addition, we find drought persistence remains relatively stationary over the last half century. The findings can inform drought monitoring and planning, and improve future drought resilience.  authors: Poulomi Ganguli, Auroop R. Ganguly

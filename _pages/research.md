# Research

The SDS Lab research themes are described in the [Home Page]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/) while selected publications are highlighted in the [Publications]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications) page. Here we point to a few presentations and posters which may provide a summary of our research. Furthermore, we provide links to shared codes and data repositories developed by current and former SDS Lab members.

<span style="color:green">**Funding:**</span> The SDS Lab has been and continues to be generously funded by US federal agencies such as NSF, DOD, NASA, DHS, DOE and DOE Labs. Occasional funding and in-kind support have been received from the private and public sectors. The students and postdocs benefit from our strong experiential relationships with federal agencies such as NASA and DOE Labs such as [PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/) and ORNL, as well as the private and public sectors including the Lab spinout startup risQ.
